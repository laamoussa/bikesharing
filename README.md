Summary: The data show the Citi Bike is profitable. The pike hours start around 7 am until late at night before the demand slows down. The data also demonstrate that both males and females use the bike. However, the majority of the bike riders are male. The data also shows that the demand is very high during the week compared to the weekend. Finally, it shows most of the people that rent the bike are weekday workers.
